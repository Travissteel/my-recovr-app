## 🚀 Quick Start Integration

### 1. Backend API Endpoints
Ensure the following backend routes are implemented:
- `/api/gamification/*` - Achievement and progress tracking

- `/api/financial/*` - Money saved tracking
- `/api/calendar/*` - Mood and trigger tracking
- `/api/notification-system/*` - Notification preferences

### 2. Replace Existing Dashboard
```typescript

import EnhancedDashboard from './pages/EnhancedDashboard';

// Replace the existing Dashboard component
<Route path="/dashboard" component={EnhancedDashboard} />
```

### 3. Add to Existing Dashboard (Gradual Integration)
```typescript
// In your existing Dashboard.tsx
import GamificationDashboard from './components/enhanced/GamificationDashboard';
import DailyChallenges from './components/enhanced/DailyChallenges';

// Add as new sections
<GamificationDashboard onAchievementClick={handleAchievementClick} />
<DailyChallenges onChallengeComplete={handleChallengeComplete} />
```

- Leaderboards use anonymized data
- Trigger logs are encrypted
- Financial data is never shared

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated client and server-side
- Trigger intensity levels restricted to 1-10
- Financial amounts validated for reasonable ranges
- Challenge completion data sanitized

```bash
# Test individual components
npm test -- --testPathPattern=enhanced/

# Test services
npm test -- --testPathPattern=services/
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Test dashboard integration
npm test -- --testPathPattern=EnhancedDashboard
```
